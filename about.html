  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    At Team Binary_Beasts, weâ€™re on a journey to level up through hands-on experience, constant learning, and CTF battles. We donâ€™t just play to win â€” we play to grow. Our mission is to:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; color: var(--text-secondary);">
    <li>Break down and share what we learn from CTFs in clear, practical ways</li>
    <li>Sharpen our skills by solving real-world-inspired security challenges</li>

  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Team Binary_Beasts was formed in 2024 by a group of self-driven cybersecurity learners who started solving CTFs out of pure curiosity and passion. What began as individual efforts soon evolved into a focused team of five core members.
  </p>
  <p>
    Weâ€™ve grown by learning from every flag we capture, every mistake we make, and every writeup we write. This platform is our way of sharing that journey â€” not just as a team, but as students of cybersecurity who want to inspire and help others along the way.
